✅ DAY 1 — Python Installation + Variables + Data Types + 20 Practice Programs

    🟩 Python Basics

    🔹 1. Variables

    ✔️ Definition

    A variable is a name used to store a value in memory.
    It allows you to reuse and manipulate the value later.

    ✔️ Example
    name = "Kumaran"
    age = 22

    🔹 2. Data Types

    Python has different data types based on the type of value stored.

    📌 Common Data Types

    | Data Type | Description                    | Example             |
| --------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------- |
| `int`     | Whole numbers                  | `10`, `-5`          |
| `float`   | Decimal numbers                | `3.14`              |
| `str`     | Text                           | `"Hello"`           |
| `bool`    | True/False values              | `True`, `False`     |
| `list`    | Ordered, changeable collection | `[1, 2, 3]`         |
| `tuple`   | Ordered, unchangeable          | `(1, 2, 3)`         |
| `dict`    | Key–Value pairs                | `{"name": "Kumar"}` |
| `set`     | Unique items                   | `{1, 2, 3}`         |

    ✔️ Examples
    num = 10          # int
    pi = 3.14         # float
    message = "Hi"    # str
    is_active = True  # bool
